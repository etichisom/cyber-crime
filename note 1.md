# Study Notes: Computercriminaliteit - Chapter 1 by Stephanie Witters

---

## **1. Introduction**
- The evolution of digital technology and its impact on society and crime.
- Growing integration of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) in everyday devices and applications.
- Misuse of ICT leads to cybercrime.

---

## **2. Background**
### **Digital Evolution**
- Households with broadband access are increasing.
- ICT is pervasive: chips and memory are integrated into almost every device.

### **Data Storage**
- Rapid growth in data storage capacities:
  - **1 byte = 8 bits**
  - Progression through kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes to yottabytes (2^80 bytes).
- Evolution of data centers and storage media:
  - Memory cards, flash drives, internet storage, etc.

### **Technical Evolution**
- Integration of computers and telecommunications.
- Democratisation: widespread PC and internet access.
- Challenges include lack of ICT education and misuse (viruses, spam).

## **3. The BISTEL Case**
### **Overview**
- 1988: Two young hackers accessed sensitive government ICT systems using employees' passwords.
- **Charges:**
  - Theft of computer energy.
  - Forgery.
  - Interception of information.
- **Verdict:** Initially fined and sentenced to conditional prison.

### **Appeal Outcome**
- Forgery charges dropped: a password is not a writing (Article 193).
- Theft of computer energy charge dismissed due to lack of intent.
- Convicted for violating RTT Act of 1930 (fine of 1 BEF, 3-month conditional sentence).
- **Key Lessons:**
  - Inadequate legal provisions for cybercrime led to the introduction of:
    - **2000**: Cybercrime legislation in Belgium.
    - **2001**: Cybercrime Convention.

## **4. Understanding Cybercrime**
### **Definition**
- **A-Specific ICT Crime:** ICT used as a tool but not essential.
- **Specific ICT Crime:** ICT is integral to committing the crime.

### **Classification**
- ICT as:
  - **Means of information dissemination.**
  - **Direct communication tool.**
  - **Facilitator of classic crimes.**
  - **Cybercrime itself.**
  - **Evidence (e.g., log files, devices).**

### **Challenges**
- Intangible and international nature.
- Time sensitivity in investigations.

---

## **5. Forms of Cybercrime**
- **Hacking:** Unauthorized access to systems.
- **Phishing Types:**
  - Email spoofing, spear phishing, smishing, vishing, snowshoeing, etc.
- **Sabotage & Espionage:** System shutdowns, defacement, data theft.
- **Forgery and Fraud:** Credit card cloning, identity theft.
- **Illegal Content:** Child pornography, Warez.

---

## **6. Forensic Investigations**
### **Tools and Techniques**
- **Forensic Software:**
  - Analyze file data, free space, slack space.
- **Hardware:**
  - Write blockers, docking stations, smartphone analyzers.
- **Purpose:**
  - Evidence gathering and maintaining integrity.

### **Forensics Environment**
- Requires trained experts.
- Integration of ICT and traditional police work.

---

## **7. Police and Justice Challenges**
### **Key Problems**
- Identifying perpetrators.
- Extracting evidence from massive datasets.
- Balancing defense and victim rights.

### **Solutions**
- Adequate legislation at national and international levels.
- Training in ICT and cybercrime procedures.
- Collaboration with forensic experts and support organizations.

---

## **8. Broader Context**
### **Crime vs. Objectionable Behavior**
- **Crime:** Defined and punishable by law.
- **Objectionable Behavior:** Harmful but not always illegal.
- **Principle:** No punishment without legislation.

### **Law Enforcement**
- Police: Investigate and enforce.
- Prosecutor: Represents society, claims punishment.
- Court: Judges based on evidence, decides on punishment.

## **Exam Tip**
Focus on understanding the evolution of ICT, the nature of cybercrime, and its legal implications, especially in cases like BISTEL. Practice explaining technical terms and providing examples.
