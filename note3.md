## Criminal Law
### What is Criminal Law?
- Public law containing legal rules
- Penalising behavior and sanctioning this behavior (legality principle)
- **Different from Civil Law**: Civil law deals with compensation for personal loss and damage.

### Substantive Criminal Law
- Deals with **Crimes & Related Punishment**
- Determines:
  - Conditions under which persons can be held criminally responsible
  - Circumstances that may exclude or limit that responsibility
  - Applicable sanctions (penalties, measures, alternative sanctions)
- Regulates how those sanctions are applied by the court in concrete cases
- Includes general principles:
  - Culpability
  - Attempt
  - Participation
  - Grounds of justification
  - Grounds of exceptions of guilt

## Criminal Behavior
- **Who?** Natural person or legal entity
- **How?** Guilty omission or active deed
- **Parties involved:** Victim, Offender, Prosecutor, Investigation Judge

## Determine Locus Delicti
### Criminal Law: Defined by Country
- Territory-based
- **Cyberspace?** Elaborated in time, persons, and location
- Different theories to determine the location of the crime:
  - **Theory of Physical Behavior**
  - **Theory of the Instrument**
  - **Theory of the Consequence**

### Location of the Crime
- **Elaboration on Time:**
  - Legality principle: Punishment only if criminal behavior was punishable at the time of commission.
  - Retroactivity: No law or decree binding until published as stipulated by law.
  - Exceptions: Punishment is milder, age of criminal, age of victim, recidivism.

- **Elaboration on Person:**
  - Applicable to all persons (Belgians or foreigners) residing in the territory of the Kingdom.
  - Exceptions: Immunity of the King, Parliamentary immunity.
  - Regular publication of legal provisions implies knowledge of the law.

- **Elaboration on Location:**
  - Territoriality principle: Criminal law is territorial—State territory.
  - **Locus Delicti**: Actual territory, nautical territory (territorial waters), and airspace above Belgium.
  - Belgian ships and aircraft are included with exceptions (e.g., human trafficking offenses).

## Theories of Crime Location
- **Theory of Physical Behavior:** Crime located where the offender physically performed the act.
- **Theory of the Instrument:** Crime located where the tool (instrument) used to commit the crime is found.
- **Theory of the Consequence:** Crime located where the ultimate consequence of the act manifests.

## Example:
1. A man is on Dutch territory with a gun.
2. He shoots a woman who is standing on Belgian territory.
3. The woman was injured and taken to the nearest hospital on German territory. A few hours later, the woman died.

### Different Doctrines:
- **Physical Behavior**: Crime is located where the offender performed the physical act.
- **Instrument**: Located where the consequence of the physical act occurred.
- **Ubiquity Doctrine**: Crime is located in all places where a behavior constituting the crime occurred.
- **Doctrine of Indivisibility**: A crime committed partly on Belgian and partly on Spanish territory can be prosecuted entirely in Belgium.
- **Effective Theory**: Assumes any country affected by the crime has jurisdiction over it.

## Provocation
### Definition:
- The crime would not have occurred if not for police intervention.
- Origin of the act must be unlawful.
- Right to a fair trial.

### Application:
- **Example:** "Luring car" judgment (Brussels, 14 March 2007) – A decoy car with a visible laptop placed in it.

### Legal Analysis:
- **Provocation or Elicitation:** Would the crime have taken place without police intervention?
  - **ECHR Article 6**: Right to a fair trial.
  - **Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 10**: Right to a fair trial.

## Right to a Fair Trial
- Principles:
  - **Decision Principle**
  - **Defense Principle**
  - **Impartiality Principle**
  - **Justification Principle**
  - **Access to Justice**
  - **Legal Aid**
  - **Publicity Principle**

## Summary
- **Offense in Belgium:** A crime is applicable if:
  - It started, was terminated, or had its effect in Belgium.

- **Criminal Liability Types:**
  - **Instantaneous crime**: Committed at a given moment (e.g., theft, murder).
  - **Ongoing crime**: Consists of a state that may last a longer time (e.g., unlawful detention).
  - **Single offense**: A single act or abstention.
  - **Ongoing offense**: Successive acts of the same nature constitute one crime.

## Classification of Crimes by Effect Over Time
- **Single vs Ongoing Crime**
  - **Single crime**: Immediate consequence of an act or non-act.
  - **Ongoing crime**: A continuous offense.
- **Occasional vs Habitual Crime**
  - **Occasional crime**: Committed by a singular act.
  - **Habitual crime**: Requires repetition.

## Criminal Liability and Constitutive Elements of a Crime
### Material Element:
- **Commission offences**: Presuppose a positive action (e.g., theft).
- **Omission offences**: Involves a non-compliance or omission (e.g., abandonment).

### Moral Element:
- Guilt or blame of the person committing the crime.
- Only those who knew what they were doing can be held responsible.

## Criminal Attempt
- **Example**: A thief planning a break-in but stopped before completing the act.

### Types of Attempt:
- **Frustrated attempt**: The crime is impossible to carry out (e.g., plundering an empty safe).
- **Mischievous attempt**: The crime is incomplete due to external circumstances.

### Exclusion of Guilt
- Grounds for exclusion of guilt:
  - **Force majeure or coercion**: When the person’s freedom is so impaired that they cannot be blamed for their actions.

### Error or Unawareness
- **Factual error**: When the offender is mistaken about facts (e.g., shooting someone because they thought it was an animal).
- **Error of law**: Lack of knowledge or misunderstanding of the law.

### Legal Justification
1. **Higher Order/Statutory Regulation**: The offense loses its unlawful character when commanded by law.
   - Example: Search warrants, actions of doctors.
2. **Legal Self-Defense**: Defense against a current unlawful assault.
3. **State of Emergency**: "Necessity breaks the law."

### Conditions of Legal Justification:
- **Immediate need** to protect an interest.
- **Proportionality**: The defense must be proportional to the attack.










# Answers to Possible Exam Questions

## 1. Cybercrime
**Definition and Implications**  
Cybercrime refers to criminal activities that involve computers, networks, or the internet. These include hacking, identity theft, online fraud, and cyberbullying. Its implications are vast, affecting individuals, businesses, and governments. With the global nature of the internet, law enforcement faces jurisdictional challenges, and victims often lack immediate access to justice.

**Principle of Legality in Cybercrime**  
The principle of legality (nullum crimen sine lege) ensures that no person can be prosecuted for an act that was not defined as a crime in law at the time it was committed. In the context of cybercrime, this means that laws must clearly define what constitutes illegal online behavior, making prosecution fair and transparent.

**Challenges in Prosecuting Cybercrime**  
Some key challenges include international jurisdictional issues, the anonymity of cybercriminals, and the rapid pace of technological change. For instance, when a cybercrime is committed across borders, coordinating legal action between countries can be difficult, especially when each jurisdiction has different laws and enforcement practices.

## 2. The Role of European Law in Criminal Justice

**Role of the European Court of Justice**  
The European Court of Justice (ECJ) plays a crucial role in ensuring the uniform interpretation and application of European Union (EU) law. It influences criminal law within the EU by ruling on cases that involve EU legislation, such as the European Arrest Warrant and cross-border cooperation in criminal matters. It ensures that national courts comply with EU laws and principles.

**Principles of the Rule of Law in Europe**  
The principles of the rule of law, as part of the trias politica (separation of powers), dictate that law must be clear, stable, and applied equally. In criminal law, this means individuals cannot be arbitrarily detained or punished, ensuring fairness, transparency, and the protection of fundamental rights across the EU.

## 3. Defining Criminal Law

**Difference Between Criminal and Civil Law**  
Criminal law involves the prosecution of actions that are offenses against the state, such as theft or murder. Civil law deals with disputes between individuals or organizations, such as contracts or property rights. Criminal law typically seeks to punish wrongdoers through penalties like imprisonment or fines, while civil law seeks to resolve conflicts and compensate victims.

**Core Functions of Substantive Criminal Law**  
Substantive criminal law defines the elements of crimes, assigns penalties, and outlines defenses. It serves as the foundation for determining criminal liability by identifying unlawful acts (actus reus) and the intent behind those acts (mens rea). Its core function is to regulate conduct and maintain public order.

---

## 4. Locus Delicti and Jurisdiction

**Significance of the Locus Delicti Principle**  
The locus delicti principle refers to the location where the crime occurred, which often determines which jurisdiction has authority to prosecute the crime. For example, if a crime is committed in one country but its effects are felt in another, the crime's location (locus delicti) is important in deciding where legal proceedings should take place.

**Theories of Crime Location**  
1. **Physical Behavior Theory**: The crime is prosecuted where the physical action that constitutes the offense occurred.
2. **Instrument Theory**: The crime is prosecuted where the instrument or object used in the commission of the crime is located.
3. **Consequence Theory**: The crime is prosecuted where the harm or effect of the crime is felt.

**Prosecution in Multiple Jurisdictions**  
In cases of cross-border crimes, multiple jurisdictions may assert their right to prosecute based on factors like where the crime occurred or where its consequences were felt. For example, in the "Luring Car" case, multiple jurisdictions may seek prosecution based on different theories of crime location.

---

## 5. Theories of Crime Location

**Comparison of Theories**  
- **Physical Behavior**: Focuses on where the criminal act physically takes place.
- **Instrument**: Concentrates on the location of the tool or device used in the commission of the crime.
- **Consequence**: Emphasizes the location where the crime’s result (e.g., harm or damage) occurs.

The **Consequence Theory** might be the most effective in ensuring justice when crimes have wide-reaching impacts (e.g., fraud or cybercrime), while **Physical Behavior Theory** may be the easiest to apply in traditional offenses like theft.

---

## 6. Criminal Liability and Participation

**Types of Criminal Liability**  
Criminal liability can be classified as **direct** (committed by the defendant themselves) or **indirect** (involving accomplices or those who aid in the crime). It relates to both the material (action) and moral (intent) elements of a crime. The defendant must have both performed the prohibited act and had criminal intent (mens rea).

**Criminal Participation**  
Criminal participation refers to the involvement of individuals who assist in the commission of a crime but may not directly perform the illegal act. This includes **aiding** (helping someone commit a crime) and **abetting** (encouraging or facilitating the crime). Even if someone doesn't directly commit a crime, they can still be held liable if they contribute in a meaningful way.

---

## 7. Provocation and Criminal Responsibility

**Provocation in Criminal Law**  
Provocation refers to actions or words that would cause an average person to lose control and commit an offense. It can reduce criminal responsibility by mitigating the severity of the crime. However, the provocation must be significant enough to impair the defendant’s ability to act rationally. 

**Police Entrapment**  
Police entrapment occurs when law enforcement induces someone to commit a crime they would not have otherwise committed. If proven, entrapment can lead to the exclusion of evidence or a defense of no criminal liability, ensuring fairness in the criminal justice system.

---

## 8. Fair Trial and Legal Protections

**Principles of a Fair Trial**  
Under Belgian and European law, a fair trial guarantees **impartiality**, **access to justice**, and **a right to defense**. These principles ensure that the defendant is judged by an unbiased tribunal and that they have the opportunity to contest the evidence against them. Violations of these principles can lead to miscarriages of justice, such as wrongful convictions.

---

## 9. Self-Defense and Legal Justifications

**Self-Defense as a Legal Justification**  
Self-defense is a valid justification for criminal conduct if the individual acts to protect themselves from an unlawful attack. The force used must be proportionate to the threat, and the response must be immediate. 

**Principle of Necessity**  
The principle of necessity applies when an individual commits a crime to prevent a greater harm. This can be a defense in situations where breaking the law is the only reasonable option to avoid a significant danger.

---

## 10. Criminal Attempt and Incomplete Crimes

**Criminal Attempts**  
A criminal attempt is an act that is intended to commit a crime but is unsuccessful. There are **frustrated attempts**, where the act is incomplete due to external factors, and **mischievous attempts**, where the criminal is unaware their actions are inadequate to complete the crime. Even if a crime is not completed, an individual may still face criminal liability for their attempt.

---

## 11. Exclusion of Guilt and Mistake of Fact

**Exclusion of Guilt**  
Exclusion of guilt refers to circumstances where a defendant is not responsible for a crime due to factors like **force majeure** (external, irresistible force) or **mistake of fact** (misunderstanding a situation). These defenses negate criminal liability, as the defendant lacked the intent or ability to commit the offense.

**Error of Law vs. Error of Fact**  
- **Error of Law**: A mistake regarding the legal consequences of an action. This generally does not excuse criminal liability.
- **Error of Fact**: A mistake about the facts of a situation. This can sometimes lead to a defense if the error negates the necessary criminal intent.

---

## 12. Classification of Crimes

**Instantaneous vs. Ongoing Crimes**  
- **Instantaneous Crimes**: These are crimes completed in a single act or over a brief period, such as murder or theft.
- **Ongoing Crimes**: These crimes involve a continuous course of action, such as embezzlement or human trafficking, where the offense occurs over time.

**Occasional vs. Habitual Crimes**  
- **Occasional Crimes**: Crimes committed irregularly or incidentally, such as a one-time theft.
- **Habitual Crimes**: Crimes committed repeatedly, indicating a pattern of behavior, which may lead to harsher penalties.

---

## 13. Criminal Liability of Legal Entities

**Criminal Liability of Legal Entities**  
Legal entities (corporations, organizations) can be held criminally liable under certain conditions, such as when they are involved in activities like fraud, environmental violations, or safety negligence. Liability often extends to the actions of directors or employees acting on behalf of the entity, with the company facing penalties such as fines or sanctions.
